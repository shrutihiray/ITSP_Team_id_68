Compilation and Running (for Windows 8.1)

1) Download Android Studio 1.2 and run the Android code.
The code is designed to work on android device Moto-G 1st Gen.
2) Download Arduino IDE 1.6.4 and run the arduino code.
The code is designed to work on Arduino Uno.
3) Run the code on WinAVR and make appropriate changes in Makefile.
Use USBasp Programmer.

As for now,the code of arduino runs , but avr code doesn't run for ATtiny2313A for some unknown microcontroller issue.
The avr code is correct though.
